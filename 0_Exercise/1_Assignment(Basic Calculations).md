# **1.1 Write a python program to calculate BMI of a person.**
## Let your height is _5feet 2inches_ and weight is _52kg_. Find out your __*BMI*__(Body Mass Index).  
> $$ Hint:BMI = weight / height*2
    
    Note: Height must be in meter(search google how to convert feet to meter)

# **1.2 Write a python program to calculate the time duration to reach at from Dhaka to Satkhira**

## Suppose you are going to Satkhira from Dhaka using bus. The distance between Dhaka and Satkhira is _260km_ and the average velocity of the bus is _22.2m/s_. How much time it takes to reach Satkhira?
> $$Hint :  time = distance/ velocity 

    Note: Convert your distance from kilometer to meter(Use Google Search)
